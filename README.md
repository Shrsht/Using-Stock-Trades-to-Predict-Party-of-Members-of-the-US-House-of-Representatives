# Stock-Trades-by-Members-of-the-US-House-of-Representatives

-This project is an exploration of the 'House Stock Watcher" data set which tracks the stock trading activity of members of the House of Representatives. The dataset contains stock information spanning the period from 2020 to 2022 and was designed to explore the possibility of insider trading among members of Congress. This investigation involves exploring this data set to understand whether the distribution of stock types is different among parties. We also explore the trading habits of the members and the parties as a whole, while trying to answer questions like:
Which party does the most trades? Which congresspersons have made the most trades?
We also attempt to look into allegations of insider trading by analysing the type of stock buys that are done by congress people and the distribution of party purchases for particular stocks
